Rather lightweight Minecraft server plugin designed for Bukkit server clients
and it's derivatives: SpigotMC, Project Glowstone, etc.. 

This tiny project is a reminder of how much I have learned about
programming since this began about two or three years ago. It
also serves as a reminder to how much I can still potentially learn from now.


After reading over this I apologize for anyone who ever had to read this garbage, time to overhaul.
